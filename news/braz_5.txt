Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticised for insisting the country shouldn't become a "gay tourism paradise".

"If you want to come here and have sex with a woman, go for your life," said Mr Bolsonaro, according to Crusoé magazine.

"Brazil can't be a country of the gay world, of gay tourism. We have families," he added.

Mr Bolsonaro has already drawn ire for being a self-described "homophobic".

He reportedly made his latest comments at a breakfast meeting with reporters in the country's capital Brasília.

An immediate backlash has been prompted from Brazil's LGBT community.

"This is not a head of state - this is a national disgrace," said David Miranda, a councillor in Rio de Janeiro, in an interview with The Guardian newspaper.

"He is staining the image of our country in every imaginable way," Mr Miranda added.

The Brazilian president, a former army captain, is a deeply divisive figure whose racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks have angered many.

In previous interviews he has said he would rather have a dead son than a homosexual son.

Earlier this month, New York's American Museum of Natural History cancelled an event to honour Mr Bolsonaro on its premises.
