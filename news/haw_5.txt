Derek Kawakami ready to work as Kauai County's new mayor

HONOLULU (KHON2) - Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell wasn't running in any races tonight, but he was still keeping a close eye on poll results.

Kauai and Maui are both looking for its next mayor in the general, and he says no matter who wins, it's important that the next mayor is willing to work hand-in-hand with the other county mayors to make things run smoothly.

"We work at it, we have a conference for all the county mayors to get together and we do that to make sure we're in agreement and if we're not in agreement how to get on the same page," said Caldwell. "If we recognize we can come together we can have real influence in the legislature and the community as a whole."

Caldwell also weighed in on the race for Honolulu City Council 4, The Hawaii Kai-Waikiki district. Tommy Waters is going head to head with Trevor Ozawa, who he's butted heads with in the past.

"You look at Trevor, there is some problems here today ... Something is going on out in Hawaii Kai and people, they're not so sure they want him to come back for another four years."

After watching Caldwell's interview with KHON2, Trevor Ozawa later remarked "I have a positive relationship with the legislature which is unlike the mayor, and that's what the big difference is between us."
